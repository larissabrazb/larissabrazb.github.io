I am a Ph.D. student in Software Engineering at the [University of Zürich](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en.html), within the [Zürich Empirical Software Engineering Team (ZEST)](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html).
    
My research focus is on the detection of vulnerabilities on code during modern code review. I am interested in investigating why developers still miss this kind issues during the review and improve the process so that they can detect it more efficiently. My research interests also include static analysis, change impact analysis, and configurable systems.
